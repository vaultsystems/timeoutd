Description: Flexible user timeout daemon with X11 support
 timeoutd enforces the time restrictions specified for each or all users.
 .
 timeoutd scans /var/run/utmp every minute and checks /etc/timeouts for 
 an entry which matches a restricted user, based on:
 .
  - The current day and time
  - The tty that the user is currently logged in on
  - The user's login ID
  - Any primary or secondary groups the user is in
 timeoutd can restrict local users, X11-users and users via telnet/SSH 
 for a maximum of their session, max. day, idle or no login at all.
 .
 timeoutd is also able to restrict users running X.
