timeoutd (1.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * QA upload.
  * Package is orphaned (see #158333); set maintainer to Debian QA Group.
  * timeoutd.c:
    - Determine utmp field sizes with sizeof instead of using traditional
      values.  Closes: #52456.
    - Open terminal device with O_NONBLOCK.  Closes: #30980.
    - Do `chdir("/dev")' to avoid `device busy' errors when the filesystem
      from which we were started is unmounted.
    - Fix some more warnings.
  * timeouts: Add format summary.  Closes: #126543.
  * Drop dump_wtmp -- last(1) is so much better.  Closes: #22775.
  * Why was timeoutd setgid root?  It must be run as root anyway to kill
    other users' processes...
  * Add build dependencies.  Closes: #95039.
  * Switch from debstd to debhelper.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Note that the upstream URL is outdated and that the author's e-mail
      bounces.  Closes: #131085.
    - Refer to /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL.
  * debian/init.d: Update from current /etc/init.d/skeleton.  Uses a delay
    between starting and stopping.  Closes: #30979.
  * debian/README.debian: Everything already said in copyright; remove.
  * debian/changelog: Remove obsolete Emacs local variables.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.6.
